Getting Started
===============

Overview
--------

`Google Chrome Frame`_ is a plug-in for Internet Explorer that causes the
browser to behave like Google Chrome, using the Webkit rendering engine.

Because many sites are made to work for Internet Explorer and rely on its
proprietary or broken technologies, :abbr:`GCF (Google Chrome Frame)` is not
activated by default. Rather, it is activated when the requested resource has
a particlar ``X-UA-Compatible`` HTTP response header.

This application does not install the GCF plug-in. It merely allows for simple
and configurable sending of the necessary header to activate the plug-in for
those Internet Explorer users with it installed, and for those who don’t it
makes use of the highest compatibility mode available.

For further information on GCF, see the `developer documentation`_,
particularly the `Getting Started`_ article. More information regarding IE
compatibility modes can be found on MSDN_.

Requirements
------------

``django-gcframe`` requires Python 2.6 or newer and Django 1.3 or newer.


Installation & Usage
--------------------

To install this package, run the following command at the root of the package
directory::

    python setup.py install

If you have the Python ``easy_install`` utility available, you can also type
the following to download and install in one step::

   easy_install django-gcframe

Or if you're using ``pip`` (and you should be)::

    pip install django-gcframe

Or if you’d prefer you can simply place the included ``gcframe`` directory
somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from somewhere on your Python
path; this is useful if you’re working from a Git checkout.

You can then begin using the middleware and/or decorators in your Django
project.

Middleware
~~~~~~~~~~

To send the default ``X-UA-Compatible`` HTTP header site-wide simply add the
middleware to your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` setting::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        …
        'gcframe.middleware.GoogleChromeFrameIEMiddleware',
        …
    )

For further details, see :doc:`middleware`.

Decorators
~~~~~~~~~~

There is a decorator for adding or overriding the ``X-UA-Compatible`` HTTP
header on individual views. There is also one for removing it from individual
views when the middleware is adding it site-wide.

For further details, see :doc:`decorators`.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two settings that allow for modification of the ``X-UA-Compatible``
HTTP header. Find them at :doc:`settings`.

Bugs and feature requests can be submitted to the `GitHub issue tracker`_.

Features Not Yet Included
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a few things that this middleware could do which it does not.  This
is because I know of no data indicating that the features are worth the time
they would take to implement, and they could be difficult to do properly
because they involve inspecting the User Agent string.

* Sending the header only to IE.
* Requiring all IE users to have GCF installed.
* Requiring only IE users matching the condition of activation to
  have GCF installed.

I am not opposed to these features, I just don’t feel like implementing them
right now. Feel free to do it yourself or try to convince me to.

There is one more feature that I do think could be useful. It would be a set of
tools that would allow a site to gracefully prompt IE users to install GCF. It
would likely involve some User Agent string inspection, a context processor
that would set a context variable to indicate the state of the IE, and session
fu that would allow an IE user to be prompted once to install the plug-in. If
you are interested in pursuing this yourself, see the Chrome developer guide
for `detecting and prompting to install`_.
