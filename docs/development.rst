   :synopsis: How to check current build status, run tests locally.

Development
===========

Source Code
-----------

``gcframe`` source code is managed using Git, and can be found on GitHub_. Feel
free to clone, fork, and contribute.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/benspaulding/django-gcframe/

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is written in plain text, viewable practially anywhere. An
HTML version of the docs can be found online at `Read the Docs`_. If you want
to build a local version of these, you can install Sphinx_, and then from the
``doc`` directory in this repository, run::

    make html

You will find the built docs in the ``docs/_build/html`` directory.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

Tests

|Build status|_

.. _Build status: http://travis-ci.org/benspaulding/django-gcframe

``gcframe`` has a decent test suite, which can and will improve in time.

Current build status can be found at `Travis CI`_.

.. _Travis CI: http://travis-ci.org/benspaulding/django-gcframe

To run tests, be sure Django is installed, then run::

    django-admin.py test gcframe --settings="gcframe.tests.settings"

If you have not installed ``gcframe``, but are working from a Git checkout, you
will need to either have it on your ``PYTHONPATH`` or run the above command from
the root of the repository.

.. note:: In order for ``gcframe`` tests to run in your project, you will need
          to add ``gcframe`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``. (Mentioned here because
          no other ``gcframe`` functionality requires this.)
