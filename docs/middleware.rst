   :synopsis: Middleware that adds the ``X-UA-Compatible`` header site-wide.

Middleware
==========

Overview
--------

The ``GoogleChromeFrameIEMiddleware`` middleware adds an ``X-UA-Compatible``
HTTP header to the response of all views. When using default settings (which
you should), this header activates :abbr:`GCF (Google Chrome Frame)` in all
versions of Internet Explorer that have it installed. Those that do not have
GCF installed will instead be directed to use the highest `compatibility mode`_
available to them.

.. tip::

   Views can be exempt from the header addition by using the
   :func:`gcframe_exempt` decorator.


Installation
------------

Install the middleware by adding it your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` setting::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        …
        'gcframe.middleware.GoogleChromeFrameIEMiddleware',
        …
    )

Put it somewhere in the middle-ish of the list. An exact ordering position is
not necessary (to my knowledge), but putting in the middle will at least ensure
that it’s not outside of other middleware that require being near the start or
end.

.. tip::
   The content of the ``X-UA-Compatible`` header can be altered using by
   overriding settings in :mod:`gcframe.settings`.
